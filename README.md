Our app allows users to see predictions of future stock prices, improve their yoga positions by using advanced machine learning, communicate with other users in the app, and find emergency contacts and news articles. This app is perfect for a lockdown like we are experiencing now. It covers everyones needs during a lockdown and we plan to add more features and publish this app on the app store.

//Stock prediction feature

Close to 800,000 people have created new brokerage accounts on 3 out of 4 of America's top brokerage platforms since the coronavirus pandemic hit the country. I know we are all capitalists and want to conquer the world, not through war but through companies and money. With our stock prediction feature that uses advanced machine learning and AI model training using LSTM we come one step closer to conquer the world.
Using Long Short Term Memory Algorithm to predict the upcoming stock prices for the next day we allow our users to create the best stock plays for the next trading day. This is especially needed for society when everything is in lockdown and stock prices tend to jump from positive or negative. 
People need to know where the stock prices will go. We have trained the modal to predict heavily-traded and popular company stocks such as Apple,Zoom,Amazon,and Tesla. Our code for the AI Model is running on an instance on google cloud, retraining and predicting every 20 minutes for best possible predictions 24/7.
We have also provided visual appearances of the stocks historical trading prices which can either be customizable, or seen in a 10 day graph.
We created a nerual network with the LSTM algorithm which allows us to predict the following days stock prices.

//Yoga Machine Learning Feature

We also used openCV machine learning and tenser flow to analyse the users yoga image and plot predicted joint spots of the overall structure of their body/pose. 
For the dashboard we have a communication page, that allows users to create posts to communicate with other users. The News/Emergency contact page allows users to get help quick and see the most recent important news.
The yoga page, where our Machine learning algorithm analyzes the userâ€™s pose and gives live feedback on how to improve their pose by giving a reference image of a professional yoga trainer doing the same pose. (example). 
The ML model is running in an instance on google cloud, where it is ready to analyze images 24/7.

//Communication feature

We have also included a platform where users can communicate with each other by creating posts and sharing it in our app
where others can view. This will be useful for getting supplies, or talking to others during the lockdown.

//Emergency contact and news

We have also added an area where you can directly call emergency services/hospitals near you. We also dispaly news below 
for users to get an idea of what is currently going on.
